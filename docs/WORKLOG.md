# LUCKBOUND — Work Log

**Append-only session history.** One entry per working session: what was done,
what it changed, where it stopped, and what comes next.

> **Reading this in a new conversation?** Read the **latest entry** for where
> things stopped, then `STATUS.md` for current state. Do not read the whole
> file — only the most recent entry is load-bearing.

**Writing an entry?** Add it at the **top**, under the template. Never edit or
delete an older entry; if something turned out wrong, say so in a newer one.

## Session 3 — 2026-09-16 — World scale

**Merged:** PR #12 · **Tests:** 208 passing · **Head:** see `git log`

### Done
- **Rescaled the hub 10×.** 120 → **1200 studs** playable, zones at 420 radius,
  platforms from 26–56 studs to 230–360. The old Discovery Archive was 5×5
  character-heights; every zone is now at least 40 characters across.
- **WalkSpeed 16 → 32**, applied on `CharacterAdded`. This is the other half of
  the traversal budget — changing hub size without it breaks the budget.
- **Visual extent to 4000 studs** via 40 floating islands at 900–4000 radius,
  fog pushed to 4400. Playable footprint and perceived size are now separate
  numbers, deliberately.
- **Fate Engine rig 1.5× → 9×** so it reads as monumental on a 140-radius
  platform rather than as a speck. Gate 2× → 12×; the blueprint's ratio holds.
- **Chunk grid 48 → 256 studs.** Pieces now 256–1024 studs; a path-length-5
  expedition spans ~4100 studs.
- **Interaction distances scaled** — roll distance 30 → 140, prompt 12 → 70.

### Decisions made
- **4000 studs is not a walkable footprint.** At WalkSpeed 32 it is 43.8s to a
  zone; even at 64 it is 21.9s. 1200 at WalkSpeed 32 gives **13.1s**
  centre-to-centre and ~4.4s edge-to-edge. The world reads as 4000 because
  scenery goes that far — you just never walk there.
- Blueprint §2.2's absolute dimensions were relative to a 120-stud hub. What it
  was actually specifying is **proportions**, and those are preserved. Tests
  now assert relationships (gate wider than walkway, engine monumental against
  its platform) rather than the old literals.
- Traversal is now **enforced by test**, not vibes: no zone may exceed
  `Scale.MaxTraversalSeconds`, and expedition walking must stay under 35% of
  expedition duration.

### Stopped at
Scale merged and green. **Not yet seen in Studio** — the numbers are verified
by test but nobody has walked it.

### Next
1. **Pull and playtest.** Does 1200 studs feel right, or still small? Is
   WalkSpeed 32 comfortable? Both are one-line changes.
2. Hub brightness — still dark, `Crossroads.Theme`.
3. UI overhaul: resize/layout pass, mobile scaling.
4. Placeholder text: flavour lines, result card, zone labels.
5. Sky Citadel biome — blocks Phase 2.

## Session 2 — 2026-09-16 — Asset pipeline and modular maps

**Merged:** PR #11 · **Tests:** 196 passing

### Done
- `assets/` tree — `source/` (.blend), `export/` (.fbx), `rbxm/`, per world.
  `.gitattributes` marks binaries and blocks auto-merge on `.rbxmx`.
- `Content/AssetManifest` — logical name → `rbxassetid://`. `PLACEHOLDER`
  entries are legal and resolve to `nil`, so loaders fall back to primitives.
- `Content/Chunks` — Verdant Valley kit, 8 pieces from Biome Blueprint §3.2.
- `Util/ChunkCore` — seeded, deterministic, collision-checked assembly. Pure,
  so layouts generate and validate in CI with no meshes.
- `Schema.validateChunks` at boot.
- Docs: `MODULAR_MAPS.md`, `assets/README.md`.

### Decisions made
- **Socket `Kind` is the level-design grammar.** Sockets join only on matching
  Kind, and a Kind the arena accepts is reserved for the arena. In Verdant
  Valley the Grove is the only `WIDE` provider, so it always becomes the boss
  approach — reproducing the blueprint's intent without hard-coding it.
- Retries are expected: a path can fold back and collide. 5 attempts gives
  ~99% success.

### Stopped at
Chunk system built and tested; no Roblox-side loader (needs Phase 2 expedition
entry) and no actual meshes.

## Session 1 — 2026-09-15 — Phase 1 foundation

**Merged:** PRs #1–#10 · **Tests:** 167 passing

### Done
- Build spec, architecture, and the whole Phase 1 server + client.
- The Crossroads hub, generated from data per the Biome Blueprint.
- 15-roll onboarding arc; true RNG from roll 16.
- Headless test suite + CI.
- **Verified in Studio.** Playtested, and the owner's verdict on the roll loop
  with no combat, loot or art: *"these rolls alone were fun."* That answers
  Master Spec §25, which is the question the whole project rests on.

### Decisions made
- **D-8: Fate is true RNG.** No player state ever changes any world's odds.
- **D-9: 15-roll onboarding**, peaking on Epic, never Mythic.
- Rarity colour is a UI/portal contract; biome palette is set dressing.

### Bugs found (all recorded in build spec §6.1)
`Workspace.FilteringEnabled` read-only broke Rojo sync · `type()` vs `typeof()`
on Vector3 blocked boot and **passed 152 tests** · `GetDataStore` raises on an
unpublished place · `MessagingService:SubscribeAsync` yields forever and stalled
the bootstrap silently.

### Stopped at
Phase 1 complete. Two acceptance criteria (P1-8, P1-9, persistence) blocked on
publishing the place.
